a girl named tinker never smiled again,
her heart was shattered into pieces.
her world is dark, nothing can be seen , 
nothing can be heard, nothing can be felt.
she is pointless, the only thing she could
do is to cry, even while eating, reading, and sleeping.
even she wanted to shout loud about her pain , she never opened up to anyone
