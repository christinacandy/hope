a girl named tinker never smiled again,
her heart was shattered into pieces.
her world is dark, nothing can be seen , 
nothing can be heard, nothing can be felt.
she is pointless, the only thing she could
do is to cry, even while eating, reading, and sleeping.
even though she wanted to shout loud about her pain , she never opened up to anyone.
everyone wondered whats wrong with her? .but no one have the answer ,but she uploaded her story in a online site as a story .
and it was written in there that " i was continously crying for 3 days and i thought of talking about this matter to mom ,its around 10:00pm. i went into her room and asked i want to talk to her ,she said yes.and i told that i am feeling that your priorities are more for my sibling ,then she said in an angry manner both are equal to her , her anger is common to me ,atleast i was satisfied with that word , until she said the next line, and she added that "i know this is your acting . i know you are big con artist. you are doing all this shit to control us which is never going to happen, if you want you can leave the house" listening this i was shattered into pieces".
she convyed her pain in this story ,latter she left home took many part-time jobs to make her living.
as she was studying engineering after long time she received a call letter which changed her life. but could she get over her pain?
was she able to mingle with others? did she ever own a family?
